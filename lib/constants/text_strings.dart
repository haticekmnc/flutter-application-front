    'This Chinese tale is quite similar to its western counterpart but has enough differences that it may well have a completely different source. After all, stories about bad creatures preying on children are hardly rare. In this story it is the mother that goes to the grandmothers house. She asks the children to lock up tight after dark and not let any strangers inside. The wolf sees the mother leave, and poses as the girls grandmother to get them to let him inside the house. The girls suspect ill intent but the wolf has clever answers for all their questions and they let him in. Eventually the girls figure out the wolf is not their grandmother and devise a way to kill it, in which they suceed. Its a charming tale about ingenuity, listening to your parents, and wariness of strangers.';
